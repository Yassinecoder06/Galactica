This a space game where you try to dodge some projectiles and their speed changes over time
You can hit those projectiles with a bullet from a spaceship to stay alive
There is a multiplayer game where you can play with your friend

game buttons:
press f to set full screen
press q to quit
press p to pause and c to continue or unpause
press s to play single player (use arrows to move)
press m to play multiplayer (use arrows and e/d/s/x to move with players)
press right_control to shoot with player 1 and space to shoot with player 2

Also, you have to install pygame in your IDE (advice: use pycharm or vs code)
Have fun
