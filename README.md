# Galactica
This a space game where you try to dodge some projectiles and their speed changes over time
You can hit those projectiles with a bullet from a spaceship to stay alive
It's a full-screen game you can just set it up by clicking the "f" key, quitting with q, pausing with "p" and continuing with "c"
You can change the speed of bullets, projectiles, moving...
Any changeable configuration comes with a comment the rest is unchangeable
Also, you have to install pygame in your IDE (advice: use pycharm or vs code)
Have fun
