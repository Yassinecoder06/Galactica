# Galactica
This a space game where you try to dodge some projectiles and their speed changes over time
You can hit those projectiles with a bullet from a spaceship to stay alive
It's a full-screen game you can just set it up by clicking the "f" key , pause with "p" and continue with "c"
You can change the speed of bullets, projectiles, moving...
Any changeable configuration comes with a comment the rest is unchangeable
Also, you have to install pygame in your IDE (advice: use pycharm or vs code)
Have fun
